- advanced capabilities (18. 무선이동네트워크 1 Wi-Fi 항목에서부터 계속)
	- rare adaptaiton
		- base station, mobile dynamically change transmission rate as mobile moves, SNR (신호 대비 잡음 비율) varies (주변 환경 변화에 따른 데이터 전송 속도 자동 조정)
			- SNR이 높다 : 고속, 다량 데이터 전송 방법 사용 (QAM, OFDM 등)
			- SNR이 낮다 : 저속, 소량 데이터 전송 방법 사용 (OFDMA 등)
	- power management
		- 에너지를 효율적으로 사용하고 전력 소비를 최소화하는 기술
		- node-to-AP
			- "I am going to sleep until next beacon frame"

### Cellular Internet access
> 이동 통신
![[cellular_network.png]]
- Multiple access techniques
	- 다양한 이동 장치가 동시에 기지국에 접속하여 통신할 수 있도록 허용하는 방법
	- FDMA(Frequency Division Multiple Access)
	- TDMA(Time Division Multiple Access)
	- CDMA(Code Division Multiple Access)
### Mobility
> spectrum of mobility, from the network perspective:
> no mobility : mobile wireless user, using same access point
> medium : mobile user, connect/disconnect from network using DHCP
> high mobility : mobile user, passing through multiple access point while maintaining ongoing connections (like cell phone)
- concept
	- components
		- home network
			- permanent "home" of mobile
			- permanent address
				- address in home network, can always be used to reach mobile
			- home agent
				- entity that wiill perfrom mobility functions on befalf on mobile, when mobile is remote
		- visited network
			- network in which mobile currently resides
			- permanet address
				- remains constant
			- care-of-address
				- address in visited network
			- foreign agent
				- entity in visited network that performs mobility functions on behalf of mobile
		- correspondent
			- wants to communicate with mobile
	- scenario
		- indirect routing
			1. correspondent addresses packets using home address of mobile (correspondent -> home network permanent address)
			2. home agent intercepts packets, forwards to foreign agent (home agent -> visited network)
			3. foreign agent receives packets, forwards to mobile (foreign agent -> mobile device in visited network)
			4. mobile replies directly to correspondent (mobile device -> correspondent)
		- direct routing
			1. correspondent requests, receives foreign address of mobile (correspondent -> home network -> correspondent)
			2. correspondent forward to foreign agent (correspondent -> visited network)
			3. foreign agent receives packets, forward to mobile (foreign agent -> mobile device in visited network)
			4. mobile replies directly to correspondent (mobile device -> correspondent)
